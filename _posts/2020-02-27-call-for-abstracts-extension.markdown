We are pleased to announce that we are offering a publication opportunity for all STEM abstracts. Therefore, the submission deadline for the XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies and Students in the UK has been extended until __Friday 13th March 2020__.

The symposium will feature a wide range of talks, inter-disciplinary panels, presentations, discussion and networking opportunities. The symposium will be held during the 8th-10th of July 2020 in ESLC building.

The topic of the symposium is “Synergy, the link to the future”, therefore some abstracts will be selected for panel discussion during the conference, upon author’s approval. This is a multi-disciplinary symposium, therefore the talks will be divided in 4 four different categories:

1.	Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
2.	Arts, Culture and History.

Abstracts will be reviewed by the committee. Acceptance will be based on topic, research content, and program balance.
