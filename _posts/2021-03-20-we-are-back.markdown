We are very pleased to announce that the XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies and Students in the UK __will be back in 2021 (virtually)!__ It will happen this summer on the __1st and 2nd of July 2021,__ hosted from Nottingham, UK.

COVID-19 has deeply impacted everybody, our lives and ways to interact between each other have completely changed. As organising committee of the XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies in the UK, we have made the decision to proceed with the event, although virtually given the circumstances. We know this is not an ideal solution, as we wouldâ€™ve loved to meet you in person. But we must step up to respond to current challenges.

We are excited to announce a thrilling delivery of virtual presentations and one-to-one opportunities for networking. We will do our very best to ensure the experience of the Symposium is translated to the online counterpart. Stay connected and follow us in our social media channels, as we will post our call for papers soon.

Best wishes,

The Organising Committee
