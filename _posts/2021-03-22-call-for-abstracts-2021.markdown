The committee of the XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies and Students in the UK invites researchers, taught and research students to submit abstracts for poster or oral presentations at our __XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies and Students in the UK__, this year organised by the Mexican Society at The University of Nottingham.

The symposium will feature a wide range of talks, inter-disciplinary panels, presentations, discussion, and networking opportunities. The symposium will be held during the __1st and 2nd of July 2021 in a virtual online platform__.  

The topic of the symposium is “Synergy, the link to the future”, therefore some abstracts will be selected for panel discussion during the conference, upon author’s approval. This is a multi-disciplinary symposium; therefore the talks will be divided in 4 four different categories:


1. Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
2. Arts, culture, and history.
3. Business and management.
4. Policy, politics, and internationalisation.

Abstracts will be reviewed by the committee. Acceptance will be based on topic, research content, and program balance.  

__Submission guidelines:__ Abstracts must be no more than 300 words in accordance with the abstract submission template. Download the template [here](../assets/Abstract_Template_2021.docx).

Abstracts must be sent to [symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com](mailto:symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com) before 23:59 GMT on the 30th of April 2021.

If you already submitted an abstract for last year’s call, only confirm your participation by sending an email to: [symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com](mailto:symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com).  You do not have to re-submit your abstract. Already accepted abstracts will only be reconsidered upon confirmation. Only re-submit your abstract if your topic has changed or if you want to update it.
