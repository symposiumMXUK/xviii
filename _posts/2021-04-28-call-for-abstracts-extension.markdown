The submission deadline for the XVIII Symposium of Mexican Studies and Students in the UK has been extended __one__ week, until __Friday 7th May 2021__.

The symposium will feature a wide range of talks, inter-disciplinary panels, presentations, discussion and networking opportunities. The symposium will be held online the 1st-2nd of July 2021.

The topic of the symposium is “Synergy, the link to the future”, therefore some abstracts will be selected for panel discussion during the conference, upon author’s approval. This is a multi-disciplinary symposium; therefore the talks will be divided in 4 four different categories:

1. Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
2. Arts, culture, and history.
3. Business and management.
4. Policy, politics, and internationalisation.

Abstracts will be reviewed by the committee. Acceptance will be based on topic, research content, and program balance.  

__Submission guidelines:__ Abstracts must be no more than 300 words in accordance with the abstract submission template. Download the template [here](../assets/Abstract_Template_2021.docx).

Abstracts must be sent to [symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com](mailto:symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com) before 23:59 BST on the 7th of May 2021.

If you already submitted an abstract for last year’s call, only confirm your participation by sending an email to: [symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com](mailto:symposium.mxuk.2020@gmail.com).  You do not have to re-submit your abstract. Already accepted abstracts will only be reconsidered upon confirmation. Only re-submit your abstract if your topic has changed or if you want to update it.

* __7th May 2021:__ Abstract submission extended deadline.
* __15th - 30th May 2021:__ Notification of acceptance.
* __15th June 2021:__ Registration deadline.
